Description: Assess whether and how a specific continuous or categorical exposure affects the outcome of interest through one mediator using a two-way cross test (CT). The CT method allows to make inference for composite null hypotheses of no mediation effect, providing valid type I error control and thus optimizes statistical power. For more technical details, refer to Chen, C., Zhou, L., Song, P.X.K. (2025), "An Efficient Two-Way Cross Test for Mediation Effects with High Sensitivity to Weak Signals" arXiv preprint.
